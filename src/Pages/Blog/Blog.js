            How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h2>
            <p>Answer: <br />
            Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]].  The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects.  It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.

            What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
            </h2>
            <p>Answer: <br />
            Unit Testing is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers. Unit Tests isolate a section of code and verify its correctness. A unit may be an individual function, method, procedure, module, or object.
